## Play the game

Compile it yourself... But, be warned! There is currently zero gameplay!

## Paragraph that was definitely written by a human!

We made a demo of Tower Defense as a demo. If you were interested in any of the other features, please make sure to visit the project page. This project is open source and I will be working on it. To find out what we are working on, please check the official project page and I will be working on it. 

The project was built using Unity Editor and C# and we are also working on it. What is the official project status?. It's a little too much so try not to worry about it and keep the project as a full project! If you are interested in any other features, please make sure to check the official project page.
